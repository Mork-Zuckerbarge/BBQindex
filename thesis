//**Primary Hypothesis: The existence of five interconnected liquidity pools enables more arbitrage activities, which in turn reduce price discrepancies faster than in isolated single-pool systems, and creates automatic volume with any price change.
//**Secondary Hypothesis: Adding the range of five blockchains enables even more arbitrage activities, which further reduces price discrepancies faster than in isolated single-pools in single-layer systems, and creates automatic volume with any price change.

//This reduces price discrepancies faster than in isolated systems and creates automatic volume with any price change across the network.
//Objective: Introduce the "BBQ Index" as a measure of price stability enhanced by arbitrage across multiple blockchains and their respective liquidity pools.**

//**Definitions and Assumptions**
//Liquidity Pools: Let P_{ij} represent the price of the same asset in the j-th liquidity pool on the i-th blockchain, where i = 1,2,3,4,5 and j = 1,2,3,4,5.
//Volume of Asset: Let V_{ij} represent the volume of the asset in the j-th pool on the i-th blockchain, which affects the impact of a trade on the pool's price.
//Arbitrage Force (A): Defined as the influence on price equalization exerted by arbitrageurs. It is proportional to the price difference and inversely proportional to the transaction resistance (e.g., fees, slippage).


//**Expanded Basic Model for Arbitrage Impact Across Blockchains**
//Assuming arbitrage is the primary force driving the prices in each pool across blockchains towards a common value, 
//we model the rate of change of the price in each pool due to arbitrage. The differential for the price in each pool P_{ij} can be modeled as:

\frac{dP_{ij}}{dt} = k \sum_{m=1}^5 \sum_{n=1}^5 \frac{V_{mn}}{V_{ij}} (P_{mn} - P_{ij})

//+ \frac{dP_{ij}}{dt} = is the rate of change of price in the j-th pool on the i-th blockchain.
//+ k = a constant of proportionality that includes factors: 1. responsiveness_of_the_market and 2. arbitrageur_activity.
//+ \frac{V_{mn}}{V_{ij}} = adjustment of influence by the relative sizes of the pools, assuming that price impact is inversely proportional to the volume of the pool.
//+ (P_{mn} - P_{ij}) = the price difference driving the arbitrage between pool (m, n) and pool (i, j).


//**The BBQ Index expanded**
//The "BBQ Index" now accounts for the variance in the rates of price change across all 25 pools (5 pools on 5 blockchains).
//The BBQ Index calculates the root mean square of the rate of price changes across the 25 pools, providing a single metric to gauge the overall volatility due to price differences being arbitrated.

\text{BBQ Index} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{25} \sum_{i=1}^{5} \sum_{j=1}^{5} \left(\frac{dP_{ij}}{dt}\right)^2}

//This index essentially measures the standard deviation of the price change rates across all pools. A lower BBQ Index indicates higher stability (less variance in price changes due to effective arbitrage), while a higher index suggests more volatility and less effective arbitrage activity.


//**Interpretation**
//A lower BBQ Index value indicates that the prices across different liquidity pools, within and across blockchains, are quickly converging, suggesting effective arbitrage that stabilizes the prices.
//A higher BBQ Index value indicates significant discrepancies in how prices are adjusting across pools, suggesting inefficiencies or obstacles in arbitrage processes.
